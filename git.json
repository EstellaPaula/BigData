Here's my attempt :)\r\n\r\n- Can't have the UI borrowed mutably when waiting for the clipboard text, so I had to push the mutex locking down into the request handlers to be able to make the borrows work for the clipboard get command;\r\n- Using an `mpsc` channel basically as a future, to avoid extra dependencies; \r\n- I've tried placing the clipboard function into `runtime/autoload/providers/clipboard.vim`, but it didn't load for some

The problem is we have copies of references to the same object. Which reference is \"master\"? There is no such ownership flag in C#. Would be great if we had something like this because then compiler could call Dispose automatically if scope of \"master\" reference ends.\r\n\r\n@faeriedust \r\nWe don't know whether an arbitrary Option is owner of inner disposable or not. Depends on context.\r\nThe issue here is: If Option is owner of some Disposable, then Option itself should be IDisposable.\r\nThere is some practical value because if Option is not IDisposable, you cannot use it in code like echo actor (return type of setupFn = state). And of course using/use in combination with such Option.\r\n\r\nI don't see a problem with @faeriedust example because it depends on users code whether Dispose on Option will be called. You only call Dispose() on Options that are owner.\r\n\r\n> `Option<>` here is pretty clearly not the owner of the inner service\r\n\r\ngets wrong if you add this line of code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar x = _MyMethod(Some(new OuterService { InnerService = CreateSomeDisposable() }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the drawback of IDisposable Option is that we will create objects of type Option<T> where we won't call Dispose() because this option is not or is no more owner of the inner object of type T.\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-01-01T15:00:01Z"}

[See issue 107 in MSBuild](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/107).\nMsbuild team has other priorities and advised that maybe this may be addressed with Nuget enhancements.\n\nIn general - the issue is how HintPath tag is used - it uses relative-to-solution-fle dir to reference assemblies from nuget packages - thus this approach breaks if same project is included into multiple solutions in different folders.\n\nOne of potential fixes is to introduce and use msbuild property like $(NugetPackagePath) so it'll be re-evaluated on each build. E.g. \n\n``` xml\n<Reference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed, processorArchitecture=MSIL\">\n  <SpecificVersion>False</SpecificVersion>\n  <HintPath>$(NugetPackagesPath)\\Newtonsoft.Json.6.0.8\\lib\\net45\\Newtonsoft.Json.dll</HintPath>\n</Reference>\n```\n\nI'm not 100% sure it must be fixed with Nuget, it looks like MSBuild issue, not Nuget one, but adding that Property can help with some other scenarios too.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NuGet/Home/issues/comments/354657564","html_url":"https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/738#issuecomment-354657564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NuGet/Home/issues/738","id":354657564,"user":{"login":"dasMulli","id":6129250,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6129250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli","html_url":"https://github.com/dasMulli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dasMulli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-01T15:00:02Z","updated_at":"2018-01-01T15:00:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@ericnewton76 you can select the type of reference to use for \"classic\" projects in the NuGet options as described in [NuGet's blog post](https://blog.nuget.org/20170316/NuGet-now-fully-integrated-into-MSBuild.html) (section \"What about other project types that are not .NET Core?\"):\r\n\r\n![options](https://blog.nuget.org/images/2017-03-16-NuGet-now-fully-integrated-into-MSBuild/trypackageref.gif)\r\n\r\nA completely different option would be to add a NuGet.config high enough in the directory hierarchy that specifies the packages directory relative to itself so all solutions below this path use the same directory and restore paths are the same.

now, there is a project setup for the community site located on the `develop` branch. What is remaining is providing a documentation on how to get the project up and running based on the different teams members are working on\r\n\r\n## Backend Team:\r\nThe documentation team is responsible for documenting the steps involved in setting up the project to run in the backend. \r\nYou would need to account for the different operating systems the users might use when trying to setup the project.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to replicate the setup locally\r\n\r\n1. User must have postgres installed on their systems\r\n2. Users must have python 3.6 installed on their systems.\r\n3.  It would be nice if users are familar with docker and its ecosystem but it isn't necessary. It just makes the setup a lot easier.\r\n\r\n* Create a virtual environment in the same directory as the root of the project\r\n```\r\n$ virtualenv -p `which python3.6` venv\r\n$ source venv/Scripts/activate # on linux or mac source venv/bin/activate\r\n$ pip install -r requirements/local.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Creating a database for the application\r\n```\r\n# assuming the user has docker and docker-compose installed\r\n$ docker-compose -f local.yml  up -d postgres mailhog\r\n\r\n# create a startup script file to load up all the environment variables that would be used\r\n$ touch .env\r\n\r\n# add the following environmental variables to the `.env` file created\r\nexport DATABASE_URL=postgres://python_nigeria_site:postgres@localhost:7432/python_nigeria_site\r\nexport EMAIL_HOST=localhost\r\n\r\n# run the .env script \r\n$ source .env\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart the application\r\n```\r\n$ python manage.py runserver\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Frontend Team\r\nIt is assumed that members of the frontend team have `node` installed on their systems\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the project, they run the following commands\r\n```\r\n# change directory to the frontend\r\n$ cd frontend\r\n$ npm install # if they use yarn then the command is yarn install\r\n$ npx develop # or npm run develop or yarn develop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe frontend team would have to get familiar with [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) since it is the framework of choice that would be used in the building of the frontend\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyung/Python-Nigeria-Community-Site/issues/comments/354657585","html_url":"https://github.com/pyung/Python-Nigeria-Community-Site/issues/13#issuecomment-354657585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyung/Python-Nigeria-Community-Site/issues/13","id":354657585,"user":{"login":"Abwas","id":22004299,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22004299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas","html_url":"https://github.com/Abwas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abwas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-01T15:00:19Z","updated_at":"2018-01-01T15:00:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"OK thanks though I didn't install the `docker` locally, I installed it in the virtual environment.

(`2920\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2920&gt;`_)\n\n>- Fix regression with warnings that contained non-strings in their arguments in\n>  Python 2. (`2956 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2956&gt;`_)\n\n>- Always escape null bytes when setting ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST``. (`2957\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2957&gt;`_)\n\n>- Fix ``ZeroDivisionError`` when using the ``testmon`` plugin when no tests\n>  were actually collected. (`2971\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2971&gt;`_)\n\n>- Bring back ``TerminalReporter.writer`` as an alias to\n>  ``TerminalReporter._tw``. This alias was removed by accident in the ``3.3.0``\n>  release. (`2984 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2984&gt;`_)\n\n>- The ``pytest-capturelog`` plugin is now also blacklisted, avoiding errors when\n>  running pytest with it still installed. (`3004\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3004&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Improved Documentation\n>----------------------\n\n>- Fix broken link to plugin ``pytest-localserver``. (`2963\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2963&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Trivial/Internal Changes\n>------------------------\n\n>- Update github &quot;bugs&quot; link in ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` (`2949\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2949&gt;`_)\n\n\n\n\n>### 3.3.0\n\n>=========================\n\n>Deprecations and Removals\n>-------------------------\n\n>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions\n>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on\n>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we\n>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users\n>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the\n>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2636\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2636&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken\n>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal\n>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack\n>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it\n>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)\n\n>- The ``params`` list passed to ``pytest.fixture`` is now for\n>  all effects considered immutable and frozen at the moment of the ``pytest.fixture``\n>  call. Previously the list could be changed before the first invocation of the fixture\n>  allowing for a form of dynamic parametrization (for example, updated from command-line options),\n>  but this was an unwanted implementation detail which complicated the internals and prevented\n>  some internal cleanup. See issue `2959 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2959&gt;`_\n>  for details and a recommended workaround.\n\n>Features\n>--------\n\n>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``\n>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)\n\n>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available\n>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and\n>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``\n>  declarations on functions. (`2267\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)\n\n>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)\n\n>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The\n>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``\n>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)\n\n>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)\n\n>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.\n>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options\n>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using\n>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test\n>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).\n>  For more information, please see the `logging docs\n>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was\n>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog\n>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch\n>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the\n>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has\n>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the\n>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)\n\n>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)\n\n>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and\n>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from\n>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from\n>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)\n\n>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with\n>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Bug Fixes\n>---------\n\n>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.\n>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now\n>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)\n\n>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the\n>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new\n>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized\n>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an\n>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to\n>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its\n>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``\n>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and\n>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)\n\n>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being\n>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,\n>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation\n>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)\n\n>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from\n>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)\n\n>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which\n>  should not be rewritten. (`2939\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)\n\n>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Trivial/Internal Changes\n>------------------------\n\n>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal\n>  structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2641&gt;`_)\n\n>- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (`2642\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2642&gt;`_)\n\n>- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we&#39;re missing out on its latest changes for not\n>  much benefit (`2719 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2719&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the\n>  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2734&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)\n\n>- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function\n>  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (`2876\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2876&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.\n>  (`2877 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2877&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2910&gt;`_)\n\n>- Configure ``pytest`` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported\n>  Python versions. (`2922\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2922&gt;`_)\n\n\n\n\n>### 3.2.5\n\n>=========================\n\n>Bug Fixes\n>---------\n\n>- Remove ``py&lt;1.5`` restriction from ``pytest`` as this can cause version\n>  conflicts in some installations. (`2926\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2926&gt;`_)\n\n\n\n\n>### 3.2.4\n\n>=========================\n\n>Bug Fixes\n>---------\n\n>- Fix the bug where running with ``--pyargs`` will result in items with\n>  empty ``parent.nodeid`` if run from a different root directory. (`2775\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2775&gt;`_)\n\n>- Fix issue with ``pytest.parametrize`` if argnames was specified as keyword arguments.\n>  (`2819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2819&gt;`_)\n\n>- Strip whitespace from marker names when reading them from INI config. (`2856\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2856&gt;`_)\n\n>- Show full context of doctest source in the pytest output, if the line number of\n>  failed example in the docstring is &lt; 9. (`2882\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2882&gt;`_)\n\n>- Match fixture paths against actual path segments in order to avoid matching folders which share a prefix.\n>  (`2836 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2836&gt;`_)\n\n>Improved Documentation\n>----------------------\n\n>- Introduce a dedicated section about conftest.py.

(2550)\n>- Change base class of ClientConnectorSSLError to ClientSSLError from\n>  ClientConnectorError. (2563)\n>- Return client connection back to free pool on error in `connector.connect()`.\n>  (2567)\n\n\n\n\n>### 2.3.3\n\n>==================\n\n>- Having a `;` in Response content type does not assume it contains a charset\n>  anymore. (2197)\n>- Use `getattr(asyncio, &#39;async&#39;)` for keeping compatibility with Python 3.7.\n>  (2476)\n>- Ignore `NotImplementedError` raised by `set_child_watcher` from `uvloop`.\n>  (2491)\n>- Fix warning in `ClientSession.__del__` by stopping to try to close it.\n>  (2523)\n>- Fixed typo&#39;s in Third-party libraries page. And added async-v20 to the list\n>  (2510)\n\n\n\n\n>### 2.3.2\n\n>==================\n\n>- Fix passing client max size on cloning request obj. (2385)\n>- Fix ClientConnectorSSLError and ClientProxyConnectionError for proxy\n>  connector. (2408)\n>- Drop generated `_http_parser` shared object from tarball distribution.

(2441)\n>- Rename `from_env` to `trust_env` in client reference. (2451)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### pytest 3.2.3 -> 3.3.0\n\n>### 3.3.0\n\n>=========================\n\n>Deprecations and Removals\n>-------------------------\n\n>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions\n>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on\n>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we\n>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users\n>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the\n>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2236\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2236&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken\n>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal\n>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack\n>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it\n>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)\n\n>Features\n>--------\n\n>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``\n>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)\n\n>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available\n>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and\n>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``\n>  declarations on functions. (`2267\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)\n\n>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)\n\n>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The\n>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``\n>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)\n\n>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)\n\n>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.\n>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options\n>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using\n>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test\n>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).\n>  For more information, please see the `logging docs\n>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was\n>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog\n>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch\n>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the\n>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has\n>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the\n>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)\n\n>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)\n\n>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and\n>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from\n>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from\n>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)\n\n>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with\n>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Bug Fixes\n>---------\n\n>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.\n>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now\n>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)\n\n>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the\n>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new\n>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized\n>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an\n>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to\n>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its\n>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``\n>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and\n>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)\n\n>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being\n>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,\n>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation\n>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)\n\n>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from\n>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)\n\n>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which\n>  should not be rewritten. (`2939\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)\n\n>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Trivial/Internal Changes\n>------------------------\n\n>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal\n>  structures to ease code maintainability.

(2550)\n>- Change base class of ClientConnectorSSLError to ClientSSLError from\n>  ClientConnectorError. (2563)\n>- Return client connection back to free pool on error in `connector.connect()`.\n>  (2567)\n\n\n\n\n>### 2.3.3\n\n>==================\n\n>- Having a `;` in Response content type does not assume it contains a charset\n>  anymore. (2197)\n>- Use `getattr(asyncio, &#39;async&#39;)` for keeping compatibility with Python 3.7.\n>  (2476)\n>- Ignore `NotImplementedError` raised by `set_child_watcher` from `uvloop`.\n>  (2491)\n>- Fix warning in `ClientSession.__del__` by stopping to try to close it.\n>  (2523)\n>- Fixed typo&#39;s in Third-party libraries page.

(2451)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### pytest 3.2.3 -> 3.3.0\n\n>### 3.3.0\n\n>=========================\n\n>Deprecations and Removals\n>-------------------------\n\n>- Pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions\n>  are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on\n>  the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we\n>  decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users\n>  which still require those versions should pin pytest to ``&lt;3.3``. (`2812\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2812&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove internal ``_preloadplugins()`` function. This removal is part of the\n>  ``pytest_namespace()`` hook deprecation. (`2236\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2236&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internally change ``CallSpec2`` to have a list of marks instead of a broken\n>  mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal\n>  ``CallSpec2`` class. (`2672\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2672&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove ParameterSet.deprecated_arg_dict - its not a public api and the lack\n>  of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2675&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove the internal multi-typed attribute ``Node._evalskip`` and replace it\n>  with the boolean ``Node._skipped_by_mark``. (`2767\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)\n\n>Features\n>--------\n\n>- ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hook can now receive a ``request``\n>  argument. (`2124 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)\n\n>- Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available\n>  arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and\n>  funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect ``__signature__``\n>  declarations on functions. (`2267\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2267&gt;`_)\n\n>- Report tests with global ``pytestmark`` variable only once. (`2549\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2549&gt;`_)\n\n>- Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The\n>  previous output style can be set by configuring the ``console_output_style``\n>  setting to ``classic``. (`2657 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2657&gt;`_)\n\n>- Match ``warns`` signature to ``raises`` by adding ``match`` keyword. (`2708\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2708&gt;`_)\n\n>- Pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module.\n>  The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options\n>  in ``pytest.ini``, the command line and also during individual tests using\n>  markers. Also, a ``caplog`` fixture is available that enables users to test\n>  the captured log during specific tests (similar to ``capsys`` for example).\n>  For more information, please see the `logging docs\n>  &lt;https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/logging.html&gt;`_. This feature was\n>  introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog\n>  &lt;https://pypi.org/project/pytest-catchlog/&gt;`_ plugin, thanks to `Thomas Hisch\n>  &lt;https://github.com/thisch&gt;`_. Be advised that during the merging the\n>  backward compatibility interface with the defunct ``pytest-capturelog`` has\n>  been dropped. (`2794 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2794&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``allow_module_level`` kwarg to ``pytest.skip()``, enabling to skip the\n>  whole module. (`2808 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2808&gt;`_)\n\n>- Allow setting ``file_or_dir``, ``-c``, and ``-o`` in PYTEST_ADDOPTS. (`2824\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2824&gt;`_)\n\n>- Return stdout/stderr capture results as a ``namedtuple``, so ``out`` and\n>  ``err`` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2879&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``capfdbinary``, a version of ``capfd`` which returns bytes from\n>  ``readouterr()``. (`2923\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2923&gt;`_)\n\n>- Add ``capsysbinary`` a version of ``capsys`` which returns bytes from\n>  ``readouterr()``. (`2934\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2934&gt;`_)\n\n>- Implement feature to skip ``setup.py`` files when run with\n>  ``--doctest-modules``. (`502\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/502&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Bug Fixes\n>---------\n\n>- Resume output capturing after ``capsys/capfd.disabled()`` context manager.\n>  (`1993 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1993&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``pytest_fixture_setup`` and ``pytest_fixture_post_finalizer`` hooks are now\n>  called for all ``conftest.py`` files. (`2124\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2124&gt;`_)\n\n>- If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the\n>  original traceback. In python2 it will show the original traceback with a new\n>  message that explains in which plugin. In python3 it will show 2 canonized\n>  exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an\n>  exception that PyTest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2491&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2709&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal ``pytester`` plugin properly encodes ``bytes`` arguments to\n>  ``utf-8``. (`2738 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2738&gt;`_)\n\n>- ``testdir`` now uses use the same method used by ``tmpdir`` to create its\n>  temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the ``testdir``\n>  directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and\n>  avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2751&gt;`_)\n\n>- Pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being\n>  non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this,\n>  warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation\n>  for safety. (`2809 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2809&gt;`_)\n\n>- Change return value of pytest command when ``--maxfail`` is reached from\n>  ``2`` (interrupted) to ``1`` (failed). (`2845\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2845&gt;`_)\n\n>- Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which\n>  should not be rewritten. (`2939\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2939&gt;`_)\n\n>- Handle marks without description in ``pytest.ini``. (`2942\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2942&gt;`_)\n\n\n>Trivial/Internal Changes\n>------------------------\n\n>- pytest now depends on `attrs &lt;https://pypi.org/project/attrs/&gt;`_ for internal\n>  structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2641&gt;`_)\n\n>- Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use ``six``. (`2642\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2642&gt;`_)\n\n>- Stop vendoring ``pluggy`` - we&#39;re missing out on its latest changes for not\n>  much benefit (`2719 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2719&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the\n>  backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2734&gt;`_)\n\n>- Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2767&gt;`_)\n\n>- Calls to ``Metafunc.addcall`` now emit a deprecation warning. This function\n>  is scheduled to be removed in ``pytest-4.0``. (`2876\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2876&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place.\n>  (`2877 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2877&gt;`_)\n\n>- Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2910&gt;`_)\n\n>- Configure ``pytest`` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported\n>  Python versions. (`2922\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2922&gt;`_)\n\n\n\n\n>### 3.2.5\n\n>=========================\n\n>Bug Fixes\n>---------\n\n>- Remove ``py&lt;1.5`` restriction from ``pytest`` as this can cause version\n>  conflicts in some installations. (`2926\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2926&gt;`_)\n\n\n\n\n>### 3.2.4\n\n>=========================\n\n>Bug Fixes\n>---------\n\n>- Fix the bug where running with ``--pyargs`` will result in items with\n>  empty ``parent.nodeid`` if run from a different root directory. (`2775\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2775&gt;`_)\n\n>- Fix issue with ``pytest.parametrize`` if argnames was specified as keyword arguments.\n>  (`2819 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2819&gt;`_)\n\n>- Strip whitespace from marker names when reading them from INI config. (`2856\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2856&gt;`_)\n\n>- Show full context of doctest source in the pytest output, if the line number of\n>  failed example in the docstring is &lt; 9. (`2882\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2882&gt;`_)\n\n>- Match fixture paths against actual path segments in order to avoid matching folders which share a prefix.\n>  (`2836 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2836&gt;`_)\n\n>Improved Documentation\n>----------------------\n\n>- Introduce a dedicated section about conftest.py. (`1505\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1505&gt;`_)\n\n>- Explicitly mention ``xpass`` in the documentation of ``xfail``. (`1997\n>  &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1997&gt;`_)\n\n>- Append example for pytest.param in the example/parametrize document.

Thanks, Loïc Dachary.  Closes\n>  `issue 265`_ and `issue 101`_.\n\n>- Fixed a race condition when saving data and multiple threads are tracing\n>  (`issue 581`_). It could produce a &quot;dictionary changed size during iteration&quot;\n>  RuntimeError.  I believe this mostly but not entirely fixes the race\n>  condition.  A true fix would likely be too expensive.  Thanks, Peter Baughman\n>  for the debugging, and Olivier Grisel for the fix with tests.\n\n>- Configuration values which are file paths will now apply tilde-expansion,\n>  closing `issue 589`_.\n\n>- Now secondary config files like tox.ini and setup.cfg can be specified\n>  explicitly, and prefixed sections like `[coverage:run]` will be read. Fixes\n>  `issue 588`_.\n\n>- Be more flexible about the command name displayed by help, fixing\n>  `issue 600`_.
